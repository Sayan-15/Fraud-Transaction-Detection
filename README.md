# Fraud-Transaction-Detection

### Introduction

This notebook is dedicated to conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and building a Predictive Machine Learning Model for the purpose of fraud detection. The significance of fraud detection spans across various industries, including banking and finance, insurance, law enforcement, government agencies, and more.

In recent times, there has been a substantial surge in fraudulent attempts, rendering fraud detection not only crucial but also a challenging task. Despite extensive efforts and human oversight, substantial financial losses are incurred due to fraudulent activities. Fraud can manifest through diverse methods such as stolen credit cards, deceptive accounting practices, phishing emails, and more. Detecting fraud becomes particularly challenging in large populations with relatively small instances.

The intersection of data mining and machine learning plays a pivotal role in anticipating and swiftly identifying fraudulent activities, enabling prompt actions to mitigate costs. Leveraging data mining tools allows for the examination of a vast number of transactions, unveiling patterns that facilitate the identification of fraudulent transactions.
